## Contribution model

### Steering committee üèÜ

Members of the steering committee work together to provide guidance and future direction to the project. Each committee member has a particular expertise which they share their knowledge on, and work to lead further improvements to the project in that area. In addition, each member of the committee leads a project tracked under our Github projects.

### Collaborators üëç

Collaborators are members who are contributing to the repository on a regular basis, through suggesting new best practices, triaging issues, reviewing pull requests and more. They help the steering committee to ensure that the content provided is of a high standard, up-to-date with the industry, and available in many languages. Members who are displaying the above activity, and quality of contribution will be invited to become a collaborator.

On the occasion where a collaborator becomes inactive for some time, they will be asked if they would still like to contribute as a collaborator or leave their role, being acknowledged as a past collaborator.

### Flowers and stars

Every addition to the project are acknowledged by the author gaining a place on the home page. A flower üåª marks a successful pull request. A star of honor ‚≠ê is assigned to contributors who propose and write a new best practice to our guide.
