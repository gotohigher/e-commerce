# Operations Manual - Organizing and Maximizing Our Work
Building a community and knowledge by efficiently handling issues

## Handling issues and PR

<br/>
In a nutshell, every issue and PR should get tagged by one of our core team and routed to the person who specializes in the related topic. This person then, will warmly welcome and kick the discussion shortly (hopefully within 48 hours). The goal of each issue/pr is to learn, improve and join the opener to our forces.

We count on our core team to visit almost everyday and route inquiries - this way the workflow is not depend upon any specific person rather on our entire team.

Any new content should conform to our writing guidelines

## Monthly maintenance

<br/>
On every month a maintainer on call will open an issue for maintenance work and record within all the actions to perform by the end of the month (e.g. assign flower to a contributor). On the end of the corresponding month, the maintainer will run the following checklist

Maintainer on call: @someone
