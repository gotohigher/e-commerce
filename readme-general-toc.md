## âœ” Use async-await for async error handling

**TL;DR:** Handling async errors in callback style is probably the fastest way to hell (a.k.a the pyramid of doom). The best gift you can give to your code is using instead a reputable promise library or async-await which provides much compact and familiar code syntax like try-catch

**Otherwise:** Node.JS callback style, function(err, response), is a promising way to un-maintainable code due to the mix of error handling with casual code, excessive nesting and awkward coding patterns
