# Remove development dependencies

<br/><br/>

### One Paragraph Explainer

Dev dependencies greatly increase the container attack surface (i.e. potential security weakness) and the container size. As an example, some of the most impactful npm security breaches were originated from devDependecies like [eslint-scope](https://eslint.org/blog/2018/07/postmortem-for-malicious-package-publishes) or affected dev packages like [event-stream that was used by nodemon](https://snyk.io/blog/a-post-mortem-of-the-malicious-event-stream-backdoor/). For those reasons, the image that is finally shipped to production should be safe and minimal. Running npm install with a --production is a great start however it get even safer to run 'npm ci' that ensure a fresh install and the existence of lock file. Removing the local cache can shave additional tens of MB. Often there is a need to test or debug within a container using devDependencies - In that case, multi stage builds can help in having different sets of dependencies and finally only those for production (See dedicated bullet on multi stage builds)

### Code Example – Installing for production

<details>

<summary><strong>Dockerfile</strong></summary>

```
FROM node:12-slim AS build
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci --production && npm clean cache --force

# The rest comes here
```

</details>

### Code Example Anti-Pattern – Installing all dependencies

<details>

<summary><strong>Dockerfile</strong></summary>

```

FROM node:12-slim AS build
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
# Two mistakes below: Installing dev dependencies, not deleting the cache after npm install
RUN npm install

# The rest comes here
```

</details>

### Blog Quote: "npm ci is also more strict than a regular install"

From [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/ci.html)

> This command is similar to npm-install, except it’s meant to be used in automated environments such as test platforms, continuous integration, and deployment – or any situation where you want to make sure you’re doing a clean install of your dependencies. It can be significantly faster than a regular npm install by skipping certain user-oriented features. It is also more strict than a regular install, which can help catch errors or inconsistencies caused by the incrementally-installed local environments of most npm users.
