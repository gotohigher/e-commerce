Node handles the Event Loop on a single thread rotating through multiple queues. Syncronous functions (usually ending with Sync) like `readFileSync` will prevent Node from moving through its phases thus blocking the Event Loop. Using too many `process.nextTick` calls or creating an infinite callback loop is another way to block the event loop. Use `process.nextTick` sparingly and carefully. Other CPU intensive tasks, such as DNS Lookup or Crypto will be offload to `lubuv`, take up other threads and starve new CPU intensive tasks. Use libraries such as `loopbench` or `blocked-at` to monitor your Event Loop and diagnose areas where the loop is being blocked.
