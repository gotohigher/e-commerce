# Avoid module loading using a variable

### One Paragraph Explainer

Avoid requiring/importing another file with a path that was given as parameter due to the concern that it could have originated from user input. This rule can be extended for accessing files in general (i.e. `fs.readFile()`) or other sensitive resources with dynamic variables originating from user input.

### Code example

```javascript
// insecure, as helperPath variable may have been modified by user input
const badWayToRequireUploadHelpers = require(helperPath);

// secure
const uploadHelpers = require('./helpers/upload');
```
