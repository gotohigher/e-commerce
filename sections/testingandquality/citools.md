# Carefully choose your CI platform

<br/><br/>


### One Paragraph Explainer

The CI world used to be the flexibility of [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) vs the simplicity of SaaS vendors. The game is now changing as SaaS providers like [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) and [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) offer robust solutions including Docker containers with miniumum setup time while Jenkins tries to compete on 'simplicity' segment as well. Though one can setup rich CI solution in the cloud, should it required to control the finest details Jenkins is still the platform of choice. The choice eventually boils down to which extent the CI process should be customized: free and setup free cloud vendors allow to run custom shell commands, custom docker images, adjust the workflow, run matrix builds and other rich features. However if controlling the infrastructure is desired or programming the CI logic using a formal programming language like Java is requied - Jenkins may be the choice.

### Code Example â€“ configuring cloud CI workflow with .yml file only
```javascript
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:4.8.2
    # The secondary container is an instance of the second listed image which is run in a common network where ports exposed on the primary container are available on localhost.
      - image: mongo:3.4.4
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Update npm
          command: 'sudo npm install -g npm@latest'
      - restore_cache:
          key: dependency-cache-{{ checksum "package.json" }}
      - run:
          name: Install npm wee
          command: npm install
  test:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:4.8.2
      - image: mongo:3.4.4
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Test
          command: npm test
      - run:
          name: Generate code coverage
          command: './node_modules/.bin/nyc report --reporter=text-lcov'      
      - store_artifacts:
          path: coverage
          prefix: coverage

```
