# Our content writing manifest
How we boost the learning experience of our readers

## 1. Simple is better than better

<br/>
making it easy to read and absorb is our mission, we curate content. As such we focus on transforming complex and exhausting topics into a simplified list, trade overloaded information with shortened and less-accurate details, avoid ‘flammable’ and controversial topics and escape subjective ideas

<br/>

## 2. Evidence based

<br/>
Our reader should feel great condifence that the content they skims through is reliable. We achieve this by including evidence, references and data. Practically, strive to include quotes from reliable sources, show benchmarks, related design patterns or any scientific measure to prove your claims


## 3.	MECE (Mutually Exclusive and Collaboratively Exhausting)
Not only the content is greatly edited and reliable, skimming through it also provides full coverage of the topic. No important sub-topic is left outside

## 4. Consistent formatting
The content is presented using fixed templates. Any future content must conform to the same template. If you wish to add new bullets copy a bullet format from an existing bullet. For the ‘additional info’ please use [this template] (https://github.com/i0natan/nodebestpractices/blob/master/sections/template.md)

## 5. It's About Node.JS
Each advice should be related directly to Node.JS and not to software development in general. When we advise to implement generic pattern/rule in Node.JS, the content should focus on the Node implementation. For example, when we advise to sanitize all requests input for security reasons, Node-lingo should be used -  ‘Use Middlewares to sanitize requests input’

## 6. Leading vendors only
It’s sometime useful to include names of vendors that can address certain challenges like NPM packages, open source tools or even commercial products. To avoid overwhelming with long lists or recommending non-reputable and stable projects, we came up with the following rules:

	Only the top 3 vendors can be recommended – a vendor that appears on the top 3 results in a search engine (Google or GitHub sorted by popularity) for a given relevant keyword can be included in our recommendation. 
	If it’s a NPM packages it must also be downloaded at least 750/days on average
	If it’s an open-source project, it must have been updated at least once in the last 6 months
